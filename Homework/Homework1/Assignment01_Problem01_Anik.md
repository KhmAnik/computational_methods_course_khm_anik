Problem 1: Supercomputer Architecture
Answer: 
1.	The name of my selected supercomputer is El Capitan and it is hosted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore in California in the United States. It became operational in 2024. In November of 2024, it displaced Frontier as the World’s fastest supercomputer in the 64th edition of the TOP500.
2.	Architecture: El Capitan is an exascale supercomputer. An exascale supercomputer is a next-generation computing system that can perform one quintillion or 1018 calculations per second.

El Capitan uses a combined 11,039,616 Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cores. There is a total of 43,808 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Enterprise-class Processor for Your Cloud (EPYC) CPUs consisting of 24 cores with base speed of 1.8 GHz per CPU unit and 43,808 AMD Machine Intelligence 300-series Accelerated Processing Unit (MI300A) GPUs with 228 computing units and 14,592 stream processors per GPU unit. These MI300A GPUs consist of 24 Zen4-based CPU cores and a Compute DNA 3rd Gen (CDNA3) based GPU integrated onto a single organic package with 128GB of High Bandwidth Memory 3rd Gen (HBM3) shared memory. 

The compute blades are connected through HPE Slingshot 64-port switches, each delivering up to 12.8 terabits per second of bandwidth. Multiple blades are organized using a dragonfly network topology, ensuring that communication between any two nodes requires no more than three network hops. Both optical and copper cables are employed, with cable layouts optimized to minimize length. In total, the system uses approximately 145 kilometers (90 miles) of cabling.

El Capitan uses an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) architecture, where the CPU and GPU share an internal on-chip coherent interconnect.

3.	The peak performance of the supercomputer in FLOPS (floating-point operations per second): The El Capitan’s HPE Cray EX255A system achieved 1.8x1018 FLOPS on the High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark. It also achieved 17.41x1015 on High Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG) benchmark.

4.	A brief discussion of the applications or research areas that benefit from this supercomputer's capabilities: The El Capitan supercomputer supports a wide range of computationally intensive scientific and engineering applications due to its exascale performance, massive parallelism, and high-bandwidth memory architecture. Its primary mission is to advance the U.S. stockpile stewardship program, enabling detailed simulations of nuclear weapons physics without the need for physical testing. Beyond national security, El Capitan significantly benefits climate and Earth system modeling, allowing researchers to simulate high-resolution atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological processes over long time scales. It also accelerates materials science and chemistry, including atomistic simulations for discovering new materials, energy storage systems, and catalysts. The system is highly effective for artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly large-scale model training, scientific AI, and data-driven discovery. Additional applications include astrophysics, fusion energy research, computational fluid dynamics, and bioinformatics, where extreme computational power and fast interconnects are essential.
